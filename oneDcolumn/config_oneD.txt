##### CONFIG FILE #####
# Author: Clara Bayley
# File: config_oneD.txt
# File containing configuration of CLEO
# SDM = SuperDroplet Model
# SD(s) = SuperDroplet(s)
# GBx(s) = GridBox(es)

#  Note: inital superdroplets data (id, eps, radius, m_sol and coord3)
#  are read from file "initSDs_filename" which can be made using pySD
#  module e.g. via "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script.py" script.
#  Likewise data to make gridboxmap from gridbox boundaries is read
#  from file "grid_filename" binary which can be created using
#  pySD and the "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script.py" script.
#  When read from file, thermodynamics can also be created using
#  pySD and python "create_thermobinaries_script.py" script.
